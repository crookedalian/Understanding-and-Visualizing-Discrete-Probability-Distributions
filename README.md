Discrete and continuous distributions are fundamental concepts in probability and statistics. Discrete distributions describe outcomes that take on distinct, separate values, such as the number of heads in coin flips or the count of defective items in a batch. Common examples include the binomial, geometric, and negative binomial distributions. These distributions are characterized by probability mass functions (PMFs) that assign probabilities to specific outcomes.

In contrast, continuous distributions describe outcomes that can take on any value within a range, such as heights, weights, or temperatures. These are characterized by probability density functions (PDFs), which describe the likelihood of a variable taking on a particular value within an interval. Common examples include the normal, exponential, and uniform distributions. Understanding these distributions is crucial for data analysis, enabling accurate modeling of real-world phenomena and informed decision-making based on probabilistic reasoning. Both types play a pivotal role in various fields, including engineering, economics, and social sciences.
